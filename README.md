# WHOIS aggregation
Save `whois` data for an IRC user to a rolling `CSV` file using the WeeChat Python API.

The script requires the `WeeChat IRC client` to be installed and running, as well as `Python` 2 or 3 with the `WeeChat Python API` installed.

The script creates a CSV file in the user's home directory named `weechat_whois.csv`. If the file does not exist, the script creates it and writes a header row to the file with the column names. If the file already exists, the script appends the new data to the end of the file.

To use the script, you can type `/whois_to_csv <nick>` in a WeeChat buffer to save the whois data for a specific user to the CSV file. If no nick is provided, the script will save the whois data for the user currently selected in the buffer.

## Concerns
1. Script saves sensitive information such as the user's host and real name to a file without any encryption or security measures. If an attacker gains access to the system or the file, they could potentially obtain this information and use it maliciously.
2. The file is saved in a predictable location (i.e. the user's home directory), which could make it easier for an attacker to locate and exploit the file.
3. Script saves the data in a rolling CSV file, which could potentially fill up the user's hard drive over time if the script is used frequently and the user forgets to periodically delete old data. This could cause performance issues and potentially lead to system crashes.

## Potential uses
This script could be useful for logging whois data for various IRC users over time. For example, a user may want to keep track of changes in the host, real name, or username of specific users on a particular IRC network. By running this script regularly, they can store this information in a CSV file that can be easily parsed and analyzed later. Additionally, this script could be useful for moderators or administrators of IRC channels who want to keep track of changes in user information for security or administrative purposes.

### IRC usage considerations
When working with any project involving IRC (Internet Relay Chat), it's important to keep the following considerations in mind to ensure a positive and respectful environment for all participants.

#### Philosophy of Use
Tailor your project's behavior and responses to align with the expected norms and conventions of IRC. Take into account the preferences and expectations of IRC users, ensuring that your project provides a seamless and familiar experience within the IRC ecosystem.

#### Foster a Positive and Inclusive Environment
Respect and adhere to the guidelines and policies of the IRC platform you are using. Familiarize yourself with the platform's rules regarding script usage, automation, and acceptable behavior. Comply with the platform's Terms of Service, and be mindful of any limitations or restrictions imposed by the platform. Strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where all users can engage respectfully and comfortably.

#### Respect the Rights and Dignity of Other Users
Maintain a polite and courteous demeanor in all interactions. Uphold the fundamental principles of respect, avoiding engagement in illegal, inappropriate, or offensive behavior. This includes refraining from using derogatory or inflammatory language, sharing explicit, triggering, or offensive content, engaging in harassment, or launching personal attacks. Obtain explicit consent before interacting with other users or sending automated responses. Respect the privacy of other users and avoid invading their personal space without their permission.

#### Respect the IRC Community and Channels
Avoid disrupting the normal flow of conversation within IRC channels. Ensure that your project's actions and responses do not cause unnecessary disruptions or inconvenience to other users. Implement mechanisms to prevent spamming or flooding the channel with excessive or irrelevant messages. Handle errors gracefully, preventing unintended behavior or disruptions to the IRC platform or the experiences of other users.

#### Ensure Compatibility
Consider the potential variations in behavior across different IRC platforms and clients. While aiming for compatibility, be aware that certain functionalities may not be available or consistent across all platforms. Test your project on multiple IRC platforms and clients to ensure compatibility and provide the best possible experience for users.
